# Flare Time Series Oracle (FTSO)

The FTSO is Flareâ€™s native oracle for time series data such as cryptocurrency prices. It provides applications on the Flare network with highly accurate and decentralized data. No single party controls the process, and it would take a lot of effort to disrupt.

This FTSO demo showcases current and historical prices for selected tokens, providing a live demonstration of the Flare Time Series Oracle (FTSO).

You can access that on [ftso-demo.flare.rocks](https://ftso-demo.flare.rocks/).
